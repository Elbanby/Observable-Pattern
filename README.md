# Observer pattern

## About

The purpose of this repo is to familiarize my self with the observer pattern. It is just vanilla JS and focuses on the concept itself.

I am intending to start a journey in Reactive programming and observables are in the core of reactive programming.

`Note: Please feel free to open an issue if you find a better way of doing it. At the end of the day I am learning ðŸ¤“ `

## Future

In this repo I will be including some of the future practice with RXjs to build a reactive UI.
